## Data Structures & Algorithms

In the process of becoming or practicing as a web application developer, it's easy to lose sight of Computer Science.

### Included Topics

* binary trees
* pathfinding algorithms
* luhn algorithm (checksumming)
* tries
* graphs
* linked lists
* bloom filters

#### To-Do / Would like to cover

* Skip Lists
* Hash Maps
* Red/Black Trees
* Persistent Data Structures
* Tries (more detail)
* Hashing algorithm implementation (maybe start with MurmurHash?)
